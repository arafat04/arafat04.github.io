## Research Interest:
I am interested in LLMs, RAG, Information Retrieval, Chatbots and Machine Translation.

## Projects:
* bn-hi-MT-improvement-using-llm:
  This project tries to explore two things:
  1. Check the English concept state in the middle layer of a llm in the middle layers using logit lens.
  2. If the MT for Bengali to Hindi using a open source LLM (in this case Mistral-7b-bnb-4bit quantized model) can be improved by     v 
  finetunig   it using the parallel text.

* Identifying-Offensive-Language-in-Socail-media-using-NLP:
  In this project, I used various NLP techniques such as tokenization, POS tagging, word representation using TF-IDF and word embedding    using GloVe and Finally evaluated the performance using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes and using a Recurrent Neural Network.
